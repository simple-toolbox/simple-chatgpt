# simple-chatgpt

Simple command-line tool to use ChatGPT Desktop from your Mac terminal.

Behind the scenes it forwards your input to a macOS Shortcut included with the install. No OpenAI API key required.

## Install

```bash
brew tap paolofulgoni/simple-chatgpt https://github.com/paolofulgoni/simple-chatgpt
brew install paolofulgoni/simple-chatgpt/simple-chatgpt
# Import the Shortcut into the Shortcuts app:
open "$(brew --prefix)/share/simple-chatgpt/simple-chatgpt.shortcut"
```

Requires ChatGPT Desktop to be installed on your Mac.

On first run, Shortcuts will ask to “Allow ‘simple-chatgpt’ to share 1 text item with ‘ChatGPT’?”. Click **Always Allow**.

The included Shortcut uses the standard “Run ChatGPT” action shipped with the ChatGPT Desktop app: no hacks or custom integrations.

```bash
simple-chatgpt "What is the capital of Italy?"
